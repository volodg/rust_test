Part 1: Self-Evaluation
On a scale from 1 to 10, rate your experience with Rust and how idiomatic your Rust code typically is.

ANSWER:

I would rate my Rust knowledge as a 5. I truly love this programming language and try to use it whenever I get the chance.
But unfortunately, I don't have the opportunity to practice Rust regularly, 
and the knowledge I acquire tends to fade quickly without consistent use.

I really enjoy working with types like Result and Option, which I find invaluable, especially compared to C++, 
where I miss such constructs. I transitioned from Scala relatively recently, 
and I appreciate how Rust offers a functional, safe, and expressive approach to programming.

I try to optimize my code with lifetime annotations when applicable and make it more generic by leveraging traits and parametric types. 
I avoid using unsafe unless it's absolutely necessary. 
I also aim to follow Rust's standard code style and use tools like cargo fmt to keep my code clean.

Whenever possible, I prefer using iterators, map, and similar functional constructs. 
However, I don't have much practical experience working with Rust in a team setting alongside more experienced developers.

Despite these limitations, I love Rust because it aligns perfectly with my vision of the ideal programming language. 
It provides expressive, functional, and safe code with excellent compile-time checks, making it a joy to use.

Part 2: Data Structures and Algorithms
Create a data-set of words from the book https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-0.txt. Implement a fixed sized open addressing hash table by using linear probing to resolve collisions. Assume that the keys are the words from the given data-set and the hash tableâ€™s values are integers. You need to implement the following functions with O(1)-complexity:
